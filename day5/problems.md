# Day 5 - Boxing Day!

## Problem 1
```
Given 2 strings, a and b, return the number of the positions where they contain the same length 2 substring. So "xxcaazz" and "xxbaaz" yields 3, since the "xx", "aa", and "az" substrings appear in the same place in both strings.

string_match('xxcaazz', 'xxbaaz') → 3
string_match('abc', 'abc') → 2
string_match('abc', 'axc') → 0
```

## Problem 2
```
Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring length 2 appears in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string, so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring).

last2('hixxhi') → 1
last2('xaxxaxaxx') → 1
last2('axxxaaxx') → 2
```

## Problem 3
```
Given an array of ints, return True if the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in the array somewhere.

array123([1, 1, 2, 3, 1]) → True
array123([1, 1, 2, 4, 1]) → False
array123([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]) → True
```

## Problem 4

Basic python string problems -- no loops. Use + to combine strings, len(str) is the number of chars in a String, str[i:j] extracts the substring starting at index i and running up to but not including index j.

```
Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".

make_abba('Hi', 'Bye') → 'HiByeByeHi'
make_abba('Yo', 'Alice') → 'YoAliceAliceYo'
make_abba('What', 'Up') → 'WhatUpUpWhat'
```
