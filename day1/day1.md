# Day 1

## Problem 1

```
Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21.

diff21(19) → 2
diff21(10) → 11
diff21(21) → 0
```

### Starting Code

```
def diff21(n):
```

## Problem 2

```
We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return True if we are in trouble.


parrot_trouble(True, 6) → True
parrot_trouble(True, 7) → False
parrot_trouble(False, 6) → False
```

### Starting Code

```
def parrot_trouble(talking, hour):
```
