## Problem 1
Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside. The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty (length 0).

```
combo_string('Hello', 'hi') → 'hiHellohi'
combo_string('hi', 'Hello') → 'hiHellohi'
combo_string('aaa', 'b') → 'baaab'
```

## Problem 2
Given an array of ints length 3, figure out which is larger, the first or last element in the array, and set all the other elements to be that value. Return the changed array.

```
max_end3([1, 2, 3]) → [3, 3, 3]
max_end3([11, 5, 9]) → [11, 11, 11]
max_end3([2, 11, 3]) → [3, 3, 3]
```

## Problem 3
Given an array of ints length 3, return an array with the elements "rotated left" so {1, 2, 3} yields {2, 3, 1}.

```
rotate_left3([1, 2, 3]) → [2, 3, 1]
rotate_left3([5, 11, 9]) → [11, 9, 5]
rotate_left3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]
```

## Problem 4
When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return True if the party with the given values is successful, or False otherwise.

```
cigar_party(30, False) → False
cigar_party(50, False) → True
cigar_party(70, True) → True
```

## Problem 5
You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. The result getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

```
date_fashion(5, 10) → 2
date_fashion(5, 2) → 0
date_fashion(5, 5) → 1
```
